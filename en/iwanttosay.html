# Developer's Message

I am both a **Christian** and an **independent software developer**, serving as a sound engineer at my church. I've always been aware of my lack of fundamental skills in sound engineering, until one day I suddenly realized: *these two identities can actually be combined!* I can use my software development expertise to strengthen the foundational skills I lack in sound engineering.

Through sharing and guidance from seniors and experts, I gradually found direction. It turns out that **every good pair of ears is developed through gradual practice**—the more refined what your ears can hear, the more precise your hands can operate. So I began planning and developing this APP.

## Development Journey

This was my first time starting from scratch:
- Using mind maps to organize my requirements and boundaries
- Creating UI/UX designs for my ideal application
- Experiencing the dilemma between cross-platform and native development in language selection

The iterative modifications during development helped me gradually appreciate the challenges of various roles in the workplace. After the initial version was launched, I discovered that **there are far more things I can do and want to do than I imagined**.

## Future Plans

However, I decided to follow my own pace, first establishing the most fundamental hearing training in "**Frequency**", then gradually adding the following elements:

1. **Dynamics**
2. **Spatial**
3. **Coloration**

Hoping to train ordinary ears into professional good ears.

Will there be other aspects later? There should be, but whether I'll still focus on improving hearing abilities is uncertain at this point. Like traveling through a tunnel, it made me discover that the world of sound can be so vast, *not just pushing faders and adjusting EQ*.

It's still too early to tell—imagination is imagination, but we must return to reality. I hope to move toward that direction and help other colleagues in this field who can't find suitable tools through this application.

> **The ultimate goal is simple**: I hope everyone who hears our sound mixing can focus on what truly attracts them to come, rather than being distracted by audio technical issues.
